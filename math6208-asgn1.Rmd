## Question 1
# test 
The negative binomial distribution P(n) returns the probability of the mth heads being tossed during trial n.

We set the parameters of P(n).
```{r}
p = 0.5 # heads prob of fair coin
m = 5 # terminate experiment after five heads are observed
```

```{r}
data = c(5,5,10,15,25)
hist(data, breaks=4:25+0.5)
```
